1. What is your project about
It is a cafe shop's website.

2. What are you using this project for / What is the purpose of this project
This website is for those people who want to know how much the product costs and what products the shop has.

3. Why did you decide to make this project?
I often check the price of a restaurant or shop on google map or website, but there are many small shops don't have their own website. So it's hard to know the price. This includes the coffee shop where I work at.
So I asked the boss if I could try to make a simple website for them as my mid-term project.

4. What reference did you use?
Photo > Pexels and Unsplash
Fonts > Google Fonts 

5. What libraries/technology/ api you used
No

6. What did you learn? What was the most challenging part?
The most difficult part is Flex Box, but after this mid-term project, I can use flex box more proficiently than before.
